Input: An array of integers, length of n, and we define the index of
the elements as 0 ~ n-1
Output: That certain array will be sorted with SHELL-SORT

function shell_sort
    span <- n / 2
    while span > 0 do
          for collection_num from 0 .. span - 1 do
                for collection_cursor from collection_num .. n - 1 collection_cursor += span
                do
                    put collection_cursor in the right place of
    sub-array collection_num .. collection_cursor, with 'span' span,
    can use bubble sort or insert sort.
                end of for
          end of for
    span /= 2
    end of while
end of function
